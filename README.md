# GravityGame
A WIP pygame-based gravity-simulation golf game.

# Background

We start with Newton's Law of Gravitation, and set it equal to Netwon's second law

$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = ma = m\frac{{\Delta}v}{t}$

Where $F$ is gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the two interacting objects, $r$ is the CENTER TO CENTER separation and $a$ is the acceleration due to gravity. 

This can be rearranged as:

${\Delta}v = \frac{GMt}{r^2}
